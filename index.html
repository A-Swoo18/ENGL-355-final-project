          <h3>Question 1: Ernest Hemingway or AI?</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Paragraph 1:</strong> "He was an old man who fished alone in
            a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now
            without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with
            him. But after forty days without a fish the boy’s parents had told
            him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is
            the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in
            another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made
            the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty
            and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or
            the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast.
            The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like
            the flag of permanent defeat. "

          <h3>Question 2</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Paragraph 1:</strong> " To be, or not to be, that is the
            question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and
            arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take arms against a sea of
            troubles And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep, No more; and by
            a sleep to say we end The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
            That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation Devoutly to be wish'd. To
            die, to sleep; To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub: For
            in that sleep of death what dreams may come, When we have shuffled
            off this mortal coil, Must give us pause—there's the respect That
            makes calamity of so long life. "
