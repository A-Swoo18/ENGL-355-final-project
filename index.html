          <h3>Question 1: Ernest Hemingway or AI?</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Paragraph 1:</strong> "He was an old man who fished alone in
            a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now
            without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with
            him. But after forty days without a fish the boy’s parents had told
            him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is
            the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in
            another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made
            the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty
            and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or
            the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast.
            The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked like
            the flag of permanent defeat. "
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Paragraph 2:</strong> "For eighty-four days, the old man had
            drifted alone in his small skiff, casting his lines into the Gulf
            Stream without a single catch. In the first forty days, the boy had
            been by his side, but when the nets stayed empty too long, the boy’s
            parents insisted he leave. They said the old man was cursed, the
            unluckiest of the unlucky, and sent their son to a boat that reeled
            in three fine fish within the first week. Every evening, the boy
            would watch with a heavy heart as the old man returned, his boat as
            barren as the horizon. Still, he would come to help, carrying the
            coiled lines, the gaff, the harpoon, and the sail furled tightly
            around the mast. That sail, patched with flour sacks, hung like a
            banner of endless defeat, worn and weary from the fight."

          <h3>Question 3: Arthur Conan Doyle or AI?</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Paragraph 1:</strong> "In the autumn of 1878, I proudly
            earned my Doctor of Medicine from the esteemed University of London.
            With my diploma in hand and ambition burning bright, I journeyed to
            Netley, where the rigorous training for army surgeons awaited.
            There, amid the halls echoing with the murmur of lectures and the
            clang of surgical tools, I honed the skills that would soon be
            tested in distant lands. My appointment as Assistant Surgeon to the
            Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers marked the start of an adventure that
            would carry me far from English shores. The regiment, already
            stationed in India, had been swept into the storm of the second
            Afghan war. News of this turmoil reached me as my ship docked in the
            bustling port of Bombay, its air heavy with spices and the clamor of
            distant drums. Though the passes were treacherous and the enemy’s
            shadow loomed large, I pressed on, joining a cohort of officers
            equally determined to reach their posts. Our journey was fraught
            with peril, but at last, we arrived at Candahar, that storied
            outpost shimmering in the heat of the Afghan sun. There, among the
            dust and din of military life, I found my regiment. Without
            hesitation, I stepped into the chaos, my role as a healer now
            entwined with the rhythms of war. "
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Paragraph 2:</strong> "In the year 1878 I took my degree of
            Doctor of Medicine of the University of London, and proceeded to
            Netley to go through the course prescribed for surgeons in the army.
            Having completed my studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth
            Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regiment was
            stationed in India at the time, and before I could join it, the
            second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned
            that my corps had advanced through the passes, and was already deep
            in the enemy’s country. I followed, however, with many other
            officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded in
            reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once
            entered upon my new duties. "

          <h3>Question 4: J K Rowling or AI?</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Paragraph 1:</strong> "Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four,
            Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal,
            thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be
            involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't
            hold with such nonsense. Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm
            called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with
            hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs.
            Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of
            neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time
            craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys
            had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no
            finer boy anywhere. The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but
            they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody
            would discover it. They didn't think they could bear it if anyone
            found out about the Potters. "
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Paragraph 2:</strong> "At number four, Privet Drive, lived
            the Dursleys—a family so perfectly ordinary that they might as well
            have been stamped out of a suburban mold. They took pride in their
            normality, thank you very much, and prided themselves on steering
            clear of anything remotely peculiar or unpredictable. Mr. Vernon
            Dursley, the burly director of a drill-manufacturing firm called
            Grunnings, was a man of girth and gruffness, sporting a mustache as
            substantial as his opinions. Mrs. Petunia Dursley, by contrast, was
            as slender as a garden rake, with a neck so elongated it seemed
            tailor-made for peering over fences and monitoring the misdeeds of
            her neighbors. Their pride and joy was their son Dudley, a boy they
            regarded as the pinnacle of childhood perfection, though others
            might whisper otherwise. Life was good, predictable, and just the
            way they liked it—except for one thing. The Dursleys had a secret, a
            shadow they refused to acknowledge. They dreaded the very thought of
            anyone discovering the Potters, those peculiar relatives of theirs.
            Such a revelation, they were certain, would unravel the fragile
            tapestry of their carefully crafted lives. "

          <h3>Question 5: The New York Times or AI?</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Paragraph 1:</strong> "In the world of theater, customs
            abound—many shrouded in mystery, their origins as hazy as stage fog.
            Yet these rituals endure, cherished by performers and crew alike.
            After all, in an industry that strives to summon the same magic
            night after night, despite wildly varying outcomes, tradition offers
            a rare and steady comfort. For Patrick Bevilacqua, a Broadway
            wardrobe supervisor and costume designer with decades of experience,
            some of these practices are what he calls "rituals of consistency."
            There’s something grounding about the small acts: a fist bump
            exchanged before the curtain rises or the brisk spritz of Listerine
            during a backstage quick change—moments so meticulously rehearsed,
            they feel as vital as the show’s choreography. Others, however,
            delve deeper, touching on something spiritual. As actress Lea
            Salonga reflects, any ritual that reminds the cast and crew of their
            shared humanity becomes an anchor, a quiet assurance in the midst of
            the chaos of live theater."
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Paragraph 2:</strong> " Theater is full of these customs --
            many arising, like most rituals, from hazy origins. Still, show
            people hold on to them. In an industry that hopes to conjure the
            same wonder every night (with wildly different results), there's
            comfort in tradition, especially if it reaches back decades or even
            centuries. Some, as the 56-year-old Broadway wardrobe supervisor and
            costume designer Patrick Bevilacqua says, are ''rituals of
            consistency'' -- the private fist bumps or helpful Listerine sprays
            during a backstage quick change, which must be ''choreographed
            within an inch of its life'' to keep the show running smoothly.
            Others are spiritual; according to the actress Lea Salonga, 53,
            ''any practice where everyone can see each other as human'' is
            necessarily grounding."
